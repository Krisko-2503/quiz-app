## How to run the app

To run the app on an Android emulator or physical device, make sure you
have Flutter installed and set up. Then navigate to the project
directory in your terminal and run:

```sh
flutter run
```

This command will build and deploy the application to your connected
device or emulator. Ensure that your development environment
(Android Studio, VS Code, or another IDE) recognizes the device you
wish to run the app on.
